FUNCTION
A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and returns a result.


TYPES OF FUNCTIONS

There are two types of function in Python programming:
    ✅Standard library functions - These are built-in functions in Python that are available to use.
    ✅User-defined functions - We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

Other types of functions
    ✅Anonymous functions (Lambda functions): Small, single-expression functions that can be created without using the def keyword.
    ✅Recursive functions: Functions that call themselves until a base case is reached.
    ✅Higher-order functions: Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return functions as outputs.

#  Defining a function
def sum():
    return 1+2

# calling the function
print(sum())
